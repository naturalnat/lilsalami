# Neko-Salame

A Sinatra App that allows user to give cats a lil salami...but only as a treat. Inspired by a combination of popular game Neko Atsume and a meme. The design, too, was inspired by memes and other popular online content, especially those using "90s" tools such as MS Paint, Word Art, and simple HTML, a staple of my childhood growing up on AOL Dial Up to change my Xanga layout.
